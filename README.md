# The JD Auditor - Open Talent Intelligence

**Powered by Open Talent Society**

The JD Auditor is a strategic intelligence tool designed for the **People Industry** (HR, Talent Acquisition, L&D, People Analytics). 

It goes beyond simple keyword matching. By combining the **Lightcast Open Skills Taxonomy** with **Google Gemini's** reasoning engine, it audits job descriptions for bias, clarity, and strategic alignment, turning unstructured text into actionable data.
